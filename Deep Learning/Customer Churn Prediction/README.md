# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project predicts **customer churn** (whether a customer will leave a service or not) using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras.  
It demonstrates a complete ML workflow: **data preprocessing, feature engineering, ANN modeling, training, and evaluation**.

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges for subscription-based businesses (e.g., banks, telecom, SaaS).  
By predicting churn, companies can take proactive steps to **retain customers** and **reduce revenue loss**.

In this project, I:
- Preprocessed raw customer data (handled categorical features, scaling, etc.)
- Built and trained a **Deep Learning model (ANN)**
- Evaluated performance using metrics like **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report**

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** → Data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** → Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** → Preprocessing & metrics
- **TensorFlow / Keras** → Building the ANN model

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature scaling (Standardization/Normalization)


2. **Model Building**
   - Input → Hidden Layers (ReLU) → Output (Sigmoid)
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score

## 📊 Results
- Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test dataset  
- Model is able to distinguish between churn vs non-churn customers effectively
